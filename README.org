To use the build system, first of all build it. This can be done by bootstrapping with a pre-built binary or by using CMake. Either way, once you have an =lbs= binary available, just run it from this directory (or any directory with a =.lbs= build scenario description file). Most commonly this is something like =./bld/lbs=.

What you'll see is a command (or commands) that should look familiar to you if you've compiled a C or C++ project before. Iff the commands look like something you are okay with running on your system, you can use =eval `./bld/lbs`= to run it (or them). Note the backticks which utilize a sub-shell to replace the first argument with the output of running =lbs=.
